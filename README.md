# Intro to Image Recognition and Computer Vision

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating various image processing techniques using OpenCV and Matplotlib. These examples showcase how to read, display, manipulate, and save images, as well as handle interactive image windows and events.


## Scripts Overview

### **image.ipynb OpenCV Image Manipulations**
#### Key Features:
- Grayscale and color image handling.
- Visualize individual image channels (RGB and HSV).
- Modify hue, saturation, and value channels in HSV color space.
- Convert between color spaces (BGR, RGB, HSV).



### **display_image.py OpenCV and Matplotlib Display Examples**
#### Key Features:
- Timed display for images in separate OpenCV windows.
- Interactive image display that runs until a specific key is pressed.
- Combine Matplotlib and OpenCV displays.


## Technologies:

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
